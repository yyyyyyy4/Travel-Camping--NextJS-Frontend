---

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/travel-ui.git
   cd travel-ui
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
  
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
  
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

4. **Build for production:**
  
   ```sh
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## Usage & Examples

### Using Components

**Button Example:**

```tsx
<Button 
  type="button"
  title="Download App"
  icon="/apple.svg"
  variant="btn_white"
  full
/>
```

**Hero Section:**

```tsx
<Hero />
```

**Adding a New Feature:**

To add a new feature, simply edit the `constants/index.ts` file to include your new feature in the `FEATURES` array.
Edit `constants/index.ts`:

```ts
export const FEATURES = [
  // ...existing features
  {
    title: 'New Feature',
    icon: '/new-icon.svg',
    variant: 'blue',
    description: 'Description of the new feature.',
  },
];
```

---

## How It Works

- **App Routing:** Uses Next.js App Router for page and layout management.
- **Component Composition:** Each section is a React component, imported and rendered in `app/page.tsx`.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS utility classes for rapid, responsive design.
- **Assets:** All images and icons are served from the `public/` directory.
- **Constants:** Centralized data for navigation, features, and footer, making updates easy.

---

## Reusing Components

All components are designed to be reusable. For example, the `Button` component accepts props for type, title, icon, variant, and full width. You can import and use any component in other projects by copying the file and updating the import paths.

---

## Extending the Project

- Add new sections by creating components in `components/` and importing them in `app/page.tsx`.
- Update navigation, features, or footer by editing `constants/index.ts`.
- Add new images or icons to the `public/` directory and reference them in your components.
- Customize styles via Tailwind CSS or add new utility classes in `globals.css`.
