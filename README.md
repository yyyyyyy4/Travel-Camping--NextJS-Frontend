Overview
Travel Camping Next.js Frontend is built to help users discover camping destinations, compare locations, and plan trips with confidence. The app provides a clean, intuitive journey from discovery to booking, with thoughtful micro-interactions and visual cues that promote exploration rather than overwhelm. The UI emphasizes calm, approachable design, legible typography, and a color palette inspired by nature.

The project centers on a travel agency vibe, blending travel planning features with a robust information hub. You can browse destinations, view weather and activity data, read guides and tips, compare packages, and draft an itinerary. The app is designed to be extended: you can add new destinations, features, or packages with minimal friction, thanks to a modular component system and a consistent design language.
